# Wordpress Theme.Json file reference

This repository tries to be that missing piece for the developers who can use this as a guide to create their version of theme.json.

Reference codes for WP theme.json is scattered. It's difficult to refer them while creating theme.json file. Even the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/theme-json-reference/theme-json-living/" target="_blank">living reference</a> which lists all the possible configurations, does not provide any code references.

Contributions from the community are welcome.
